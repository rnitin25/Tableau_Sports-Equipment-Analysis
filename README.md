What is the market share of Revenue generated across different Retailer
Countries (Market share is calculated as %age of total sales)? Choose
appropriate chart to show this analysis.
a. Display Retailer Country names and %of Market share for each
Country as labels on the displayed chart.
b. Hide the legends that have come up by default.
Create a chart to analyze relation between Revenue and Quantity for each
Product. Is there any correlation between two variables; write your
inference in the caption.
Analyze how the Revenue generated from the sales of sports equipment
vary across the quarters in the three years for each Retailer Country.
Create a dual axis chart to analyze Revenue and Quantity sold for each
Product Type.
Create a Set for the Top 5 Product Types by Quantity sold. Analyze what
happens on the Revenue for them. Show the analysis in form of Chart.
What is Total Revenue and Profit gained across each Retailer Country?
[Profit = Revenue * Gross Margin]
Which are the Top 15 Products that were sold in year 2014? Allow user to
select the year dynamically.
Make the "Top 15" (in above question) dynamic ie let user choose how
many top products user wants to see.
Create a Pareto graph and do following analysis:
a. For which Product Types the maximum Quantity of products are sold?
[Hint: Use "Sort" and "Table Calculation" features, and create dual axis
chart]
b. Color the bars of Product Types that make up for 80% of the sold
Quantity.
For each Product Category, calculate the percentage growth at year-on-
year level.
Compare Moving average of sales to actual Revenue for each Month
(Moving average is 3 months including current month)
Created a view which displays total for Retailer Country of a user-
selected field ie the user should be able to select whether he wants to
see the view for Revenue, Profit or Quantity. Accordingly the view
should show total for that field by Retailer country.
